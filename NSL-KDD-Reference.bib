  abstract  = {During the last decade, anomaly detection has
attracted the attention of many researchers to overcome the
weakness of signature-based IDSs in detecting novel attacks,
and KDDCUP99 is the mostly widely used data set for the
evaluation of these systems. Having conducted a statistical
analysis on this data set, we found two important issues which
highly affects the performance of evaluated systems, and results
in a very poor evaluation of anomaly detection approaches. To
solve these issues, we have proposed a new data set, NSL-KDD,
which consists of selected records of the complete KDD data
set and does not suffer from any of mentioned shortcomings.},
